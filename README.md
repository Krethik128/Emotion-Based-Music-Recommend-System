# Emotion-Based Music Recommender

This is a machine learning-based project that recommends music based on the user's current emotion. It uses facial expression detection to detect the user's emotion and then recommends music based on the detected emotion. The system is built using Python and several libraries, including OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow.

## Features

- Detects user's emotion using facial expression detection
- Recommends music based on the user's current emotion
- Supports a wide range of emotions, including happy, sad, angry, and neutral
- Easy to use interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git`

3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the `music_recommender.py` script: `python music_recommender.py`
2. The program will automatically start the user's webcam and start detecting their facial expressions.
3. The program will display the detected emotion on the screen and recommend music based on the detected emotion.
4. Enjoy the recommended music!
